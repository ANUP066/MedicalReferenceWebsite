        <button class="acc">Autism</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <h2>SYMPTOMS</h2>
        <br/>
        <p> No two people with autism are alike, but many parents notice signs of the disorder when their child does not meet certain developmental milestones, typically between 18 months and 3 years of age. For instance, the child may have problems with eye contact, responding to his or her name or engaging in imaginative play.</p>  

<p>Caregivers may also notice that their child does not appear to enjoy engaging and interacting with others, said Mayada Elsabbagh, an assistant professor in psychiatry at McGill University in Quebec, Canada.</p>

<p>However, mild forms of the disorder may not become apparent until the child is older, and some people are not diagnosed until adulthood.</p>

<p>"They may not be detectible until the child starts reaching school age and starts having specific types of challenges that highlight some of the social and communication problems that they have," Elsabbagh told Live Science.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>DIAGONOSIS</h2>
        <br/>
        <p> The diagnostic process is different for every person with autism. In some cases, pediatricians may use an autism screen, often a short yes-or-no survey that looks for signs of autism, to see whether a child may be at risk for the disorder. If the child screens positive, the family may receive a referral to a specialist for a diagnostic evaluation.</p>  

<p>When diagnosing autism, specialists rely on both direct observational information and parent report data about the child's behavior, said Elsabbagh, who encouraged parents to keep a detailed developmental records of their children's growth.</p>

<p>"For older children, some clinicians will seek input from the child's school, peers — how they interact in the settings outside their home," she said. "What they're trying to do is compile and put together these different sources of information and integrate them to figure out if this a child with autism or, alternatively, does this child have a general developmental delay that is not specific to autism?"</p>

<p>A thorough team of clinicians may also diagnose additional disorders that often accompany autism, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), intellectual disability, epilepsy and depression, she added.</p>

<p>People with certain genetic disorders, such as fragile X syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex and Angelman syndrome, also tend to have autism, experts say. </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>TREATMENT</h2>
        <br/>
        <p> There is no cure for autism spectrum disorders. However, there are behavioral and educational therapies that may help reduce symptoms. And early diagnosis is key to connecting children with autism to treatment, Elsabbagh said.</p>

<p>One of the most frequently used therapies, Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA), for instance, uses rewards to encourage people with autism to increase useful behavior and decrease impairing actions. Parent-mediated interventions are also an effective therapy that teaches the caregivers how to help their children in a natural environment, such as the home.</p> 

<p>For instance, children with autism saw improvements in language and behavior after enrolling in the Early Start Denver Model, a two-year intervention that uses ABA and other therapies in a classroom setting, reported a 2010 study in Pediatrics.</p>

        <button class="acc">Bad breath</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <h2>CAUSES</h2>
        <p>The root cause behind bad breath can range from banal — such as poor oral hygiene after meals — to potentially life-threatening complications from diabetes and kidney failure.</p>
        <p>The food you eat can affect your breath. If you eat foods with strong odors, such as garlic or onions, the smells will accompany your breath. As your digestive system breaks down food, it enters your bloodstream. Pungent oils in garlic and onions eventually enter your lungs and cause bad breath. Brushing your teeth, eating a mint or using mouthwash covers the smell, but it will not go away completely until the food has left your body.</p>
        <p>Food particles can also remain in your mouth if you do not brush or floss daily. These particles collect between the teeth and encourage the growth of bacteria, which builds up in the mouth and causes bad breath. </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>TREATMENT</h2>
        <p> Treatments for bad breath usually involve either improving oral hygiene or targeting the underlying health problems.

A regimen that includes tongue brushing and scraping can successfully treat bad breath caused by the overgrowth of bacteria on the surface of the tongue, according to a review published in the International Journal of Dental Hygiene.</p>
        <p> Drinking lots of water, chewing sugarless gum or sucking on sugarless candy can also help prevent bad breath. These activities all encourage saliva production, which aids in washing away food particles and odor-causing bacteria.

</p>
        <p>Gum disease can cause the gums to pull away from the teeth, according to the Mayo Clinic, leaving behind pockets where bacteria can settle in and replicate. Professional cleaning and mouth rinses can reach into these areas and eliminate bacterial growth.</p>

        <h2>CAUSES</h2>
        <p>The root cause behind bad breath can range from banal — such as poor oral hygiene after meals — to potentially life-threatening complications from diabetes and kidney failure.</p>
        <p>The food you eat can affect your breath. If you eat foods with strong odors, such as garlic or onions, the smells will accompany your breath. As your digestive system breaks down food, it enters your bloodstream. Pungent oils in garlic and onions eventually enter your lungs and cause bad breath. Brushing your teeth, eating a mint or using mouthwash covers the smell, but it will not go away completely until the food has left your body.</p>
        <p>Food particles can also remain in your mouth if you do not brush or floss daily. These particles collect between the teeth and encourage the growth of bacteria, which builds up in the mouth and causes bad breath. </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>TREATMENT</h2>
        <p> Treatments for bad breath usually involve either improving oral hygiene or targeting the underlying health problems.

A regimen that includes tongue brushing and scraping can successfully treat bad breath caused by the overgrowth of bacteria on the surface of the tongue, according to a review published in the International Journal of Dental Hygiene.</p>
        <p> Drinking lots of water, chewing sugarless gum or sucking on sugarless candy can also help prevent bad breath. These activities all encourage saliva production, which aids in washing away food particles and odor-causing bacteria.

</p>
        <p>Gum disease can cause the gums to pull away from the teeth, according to the Mayo Clinic, leaving behind pockets where bacteria can settle in and replicate. Professional cleaning and mouth rinses can reach into these areas and eliminate bacterial growth.</p>

        <h2>CAUSES</h2>
        <p>The root cause behind bad breath can range from banal — such as poor oral hygiene after meals — to potentially life-threatening complications from diabetes and kidney failure.</p>
        <p>The food you eat can affect your breath. If you eat foods with strong odors, such as garlic or onions, the smells will accompany your breath. As your digestive system breaks down food, it enters your bloodstream. Pungent oils in garlic and onions eventually enter your lungs and cause bad breath. Brushing your teeth, eating a mint or using mouthwash covers the smell, but it will not go away completely until the food has left your body.</p>
        <p>Food particles can also remain in your mouth if you do not brush or floss daily. These particles collect between the teeth and encourage the growth of bacteria, which builds up in the mouth and causes bad breath. </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>TREATMENT</h2>
        <p> Treatments for bad breath usually involve either improving oral hygiene or targeting the underlying health problems.

A regimen that includes tongue brushing and scraping can successfully treat bad breath caused by the overgrowth of bacteria on the surface of the tongue, according to a review published in the International Journal of Dental Hygiene.</p>
        <p> Drinking lots of water, chewing sugarless gum or sucking on sugarless candy can also help prevent bad breath. These activities all encourage saliva production, which aids in washing away food particles and odor-causing bacteria.

</p>
        <p>Gum disease can cause the gums to pull away from the teeth, according to the Mayo Clinic, leaving behind pockets where bacteria can settle in and replicate. Professional cleaning and mouth rinses can reach into these areas and eliminate bacterial growth.</p>

        <p>The root cause behind bad breath can range from banal — such as poor oral hygiene after meals — to potentially life-threatening complications from diabetes and kidney failure.</p>
        <p>The food you eat can affect your breath. If you eat foods with strong odors, such as garlic or onions, the smells will accompany your breath. As your digestive system breaks down food, it enters your bloodstream. Pungent oils in garlic and onions eventually enter your lungs and cause bad breath. Brushing your teeth, eating a mint or using mouthwash covers the smell, but it will not go away completely until the food has left your body.</p>
        <p>Food particles can also remain in your mouth if you do not brush or floss daily. These particles collect between the teeth and encourage the growth of bacteria, which builds up in the mouth and causes bad breath. </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h2>TREATMENT</h2>
        <p> Treatments for bad breath usually involve either improving oral hygiene or targeting the underlying health problems.

A regimen that includes tongue brushing and scraping can successfully treat bad breath caused by the overgrowth of bacteria on the surface of the tongue, according to a review published in the International Journal of Dental Hygiene.</p>
        <p> Drinking lots of water, chewing sugarless gum or sucking on sugarless candy can also help prevent bad breath. These activities all encourage saliva production, which aids in washing away food particles and odor-causing bacteria.

</p>
        <p>Gum disease can cause the gums to pull away from the teeth, according to the Mayo Clinic, leaving behind pockets where bacteria can settle in and replicate. Professional cleaning and mouth rinses can reach into these areas and eliminate bacterial growth.</p>
